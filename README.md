# StalinSort for Cuis / Squeak Smalltalk
"Stalin Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of a random access file or an array in order. Stalin Sort is also know as the best sorting algorithm of all times because of its AMAZING capacity of always ordering an array with an O(n) performance."
